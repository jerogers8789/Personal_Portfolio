  I am a Web Developer and entrepreneur with a wide range of work experience from agriculture, the military, oil & gas, sales, and construction to now focusing on a career in coding.
  I grew up in rural South Texas and became a Machine Gunner in the Marine Corps immediately following high school, after 2 deployments overseas I left the military with an honorable discharge and began working in the oilfield and experienced many years of the ups and downs of that industry mixed with attending college and relocating several times across the state for work.
  When I decided on a career change I began working on construction projects around the San Antonio area while honing my abilities as a developer. During this time I was offered and accepted a position as the Operations Manager for an exotic vehicle importer in San Antonio and continued in that capacity for approximately a year before deciding to focus full time on software development.
